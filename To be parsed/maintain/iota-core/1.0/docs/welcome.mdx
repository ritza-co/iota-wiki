# Welcome to IOTA-Core

The IOTA-Core is a powerful, easy-to-install node software written in Go.
It provides full-node capabilities, including full support for the latest network updates.

By running your own node, you have the following benefits:

- You have direct access to the IOTA network instead of having to connect to and trust someone else's node.
- You help the network to become more distributed and resilient by validating blocks and value transactions.

## Source Code

The project's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-core).
