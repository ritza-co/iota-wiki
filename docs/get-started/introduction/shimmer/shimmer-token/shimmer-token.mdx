# Shimmer Token

Similar to the [IOTA token](../iota/iota-token.md), the Shimmer token (SMR) also acts as a medium for value exchange, has no _inflation_,
and is not subject to any fees. However, unlike the IOTA token, SMR could not be bought beforehand in an ICO but was
only distributed to IOTA token holders who staked their tokens during the Shimmer staking periods on the IOTA mainnet.

Note that the smallest denomination of SMR is called "glow" with _6_ decimal points. The total supply consists therefore
out of _1 813 620 509_ SMR tokens or _1 813 620 509 061 365_ glow.

## Supply & Distribution

The initial supply of SMR was distributed in the following way:

| Allocation       | Percentage | # of SMR Tokens          | Purpose                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IOTA Stakers     | _80%_      | _1,\_45_0,\_89_6,\_40_7_ | Rewarded to IOTA token holders who staked their tokens on the IOTA mainnet.                                                       |
| Community DAO    | _10%_      | _18_1,\_36_2,\_05_1_     | To foster community involvement and governance, enabling members to contribute to the Shimmer ecosystem's development and growth. |
| Tangle Ecosystem | _10%_      | _18_1,\_36_2,\_05_1_     | To support and incentivize projects that leverage the IOTA Tangle, contributing to the ecosystem's development.                   |

The distribution of Shimmer tokens across these categories aims to create a balanced and inclusive network, promoting
participation, community engagement, and innovation within the Shimmer ecosystem.

### IOTA Stakers Allocation

A significant portion of the Shimmer tokens, accounting for _80%_ of the total supply, is allocated to IOTA stakers. This
amounts to _1,\_45_0,\_89_6,\_40_7_ SMR tokens. IOTA token holders who staked their tokens had the opportunity to receive SMR tokens as rewards for participating in the IOTA mainnet.

### Community DAO Allocation

To foster community involvement and governance, _10%_ of the Shimmer token supply, equivalent to \_18_1,\_36_2,\_05_1 SMR tokens,
is dedicated to the Community DAO. This allocation ensures that community members have a voice in decision-making and
can contribute to the development and growth of the Shimmer ecosystem. Read more about the community DAO [here](TODO:
FIX).

### Tangle Ecosystem Allocation

Another _10%_ of the Shimmer token supply, totaling _18_1,\_36_2,\_05_1_ SMR tokens, is designated for the Tangle Ecosystem. This
allocation aims to support and incentivize projects and initiatives that leverage the IOTA Tangle and contribute to the
overall ecosystem's development.
