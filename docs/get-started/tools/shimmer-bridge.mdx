# ShimmerBridge User Guide

## Introduction

[ShimmerBridge](https://shimmerbridge.org/) is a web application provided by the Tangle DAO LLC, that allows you to transfer wrapped tokens between [ShimmerEVM](https://shimmer.network/evm) and several other blockchain networks by interacting with the decentralized smart contracts of [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) deployed on each of those networks. ShimmerBridge supports connections from ShimmerEVM to **Ethereum, Avalanche C-Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum One, Optimism, Base, Fantom, and Binance Smart Chain.** You can transfer several wrapped tokens, including **ETH, USDT, USDC, WBTC, AVAX, MATIC, FTM, and BNB.**

This guide explains how to bridge tokens with ShimmerBridge, including selecting the source chain, choosing the token to transfer, entering the number of tokens and transferring the tokens. It also covers troubleshooting issues that may arise during the transfer process.

The token addresses on each network are listed [at the end of this guide](#shimmerbridge-token-addresses) for your reference.

## Bridge Assets with ShimmerBridge

### 1. Accept the Terms and Conditions

Go to **https://shimmerbridge.org/terms** and read the terms and conditions carefully before using ShimmerBridge. Once you understand the terms and conditions, enter the ShimmerBridge User Interface and connect your Web3 Wallet.

### 2. Select the Source Chain

You should select the source chain from which you want to bridge a token into [Shimmer EVM](https://shimmer.network/evm). To send tokens out of Shimmer EVM, select Shimmer EVM as the source chain.

### 3. Select the Token to Transfer

Click "**Select Token**" to choose a token to transfer from the source chain. The Interface will display all bridgeable tokens and your token balance in the selection dropdown. Also, all other bridgeable tokens you hold in one of the other available networks are displayed.

### 4. Enter the Number of Tokens You Want to Bridge From the Source Chain

- The app will display:
  - The amount of bridged tokens you will receive on the destination chain.
  - The necessary fees for the token transfer in the native gas token of the source chain. Ensure you have enough gas tokens on the source chain to pay the fees.

<Info>

Gas on Destination

Using Shimmer EVM will require you to own **Shimmer Tokens (`SMR)** to pay for gas fees. You can arrange an airdrop of a maximum of 1 SMR token to your address as part of your Bridge transfer.
This will be added to the total fees you pay for the transfer and enable you to have the necessary amount of gas in Shimmer EVM to start your journey and interact with the first dApps.
Click the highlighted "add" next to "Gas on destination". A popup will open that lets you define how many SMR tokens you want to receive.
Either use the "Max - setting", which gives you 1 SMR, or specify a custom amount of up to 1 SMR.

</Info>

### 5. Transfer the Tokens

- Click "**Transfer**". Your wallet will ask you to approve the token spending and confirm the transaction
- After your confirmation, a popup will occur; if you click on the link, you will be forwarded to [LayerZero Scan](https://layerzeroscan.com/) to observe the detailed progress of your bridge interaction.
- The ShimmerBridge app will also display the progress of your transaction, including an estimated period till the bridging is completed in the "transactions" box that appears after confirmation.
- Once the status changes to "completed", your tokens have arrived in your wallet.
- Please make sure you have imported the correct token into your wallet on the destination chain to see it.

## Troubleshooting

Conditions that will hinder your transfer will be indicated in the "Action button" as follows:

### Insufficient Balance

- You entered a higher amount of tokens than you hold in your account.
  - Reduce the amount you want to transfer or add more tokens to your wallet.

### Not Enough Native for Gas

- You must own more gas on the source chain to pay the required fees.
  - You need to send more of the source chain's native gas token to your wallet to resolve this.

### Select Different Chain

- You have selected an incompatible selection of source and destination chain. It is only possible to bridge in and out of Shimmer EVM with ShimmerBridge; you cannot send from ETH to Avalanche, for example.
  - Send either tokens into Shimmer EVM or send them from Shimmer EVM out to another chain.

### Limit Exceeded

- This can occur for bridgeable tokens that exist on several networks (ETH/WETH, USDT and USDC).
- These tokens can enter Shimmer EVM from different source chains but are represented as one token on Shimmer EVM.
  If you aim to send these tokens out of Shimmer EVM, the LayerZero contracts on each chain can only payout the amount of these tokens that are currently locked in the contract, so you cannot send more assets back than currently are available to release. This would otherwise exceed the limits of that contract.

#### Example

- On Ethereum, 100 USDT are locked in the Bridge contract (from users that did send this USDT from ETH to Shimmer EVM)
- On Avalanche, also 100 USDT are locked in the Bridge contract (from users that did send this USDT from Avalanche to Shimmer EVM)
- You hold 150 USDT in your Wallet on Shimmer EVM
- If you try to send this 150 USDT to Avalanche, it will exceed the amount currently locked in the Avalanche USDT Bridge contract; therefore, you can't execute such a transfer.
- Reduce the amount you attempt to send until it is below the Limit.
